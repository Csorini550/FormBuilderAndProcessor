# Dynamic Forms Application

## Overview
This application enables users to securely create, manage, and submit custom forms, and export the collected data for analysis. It leverages robust technologies to provide a comprehensive form management and data analysis solution.

## Features

### User Authentication
- **Secure Registration and Login**: Utilizes JWT for session management, ensuring secure access and data protection.

### Form Template Creation and Management
- **Customizable Form Templates**: Users can design, save, edit, and reuse form templates, facilitating the creation of forms.

### Form Submission
- **Dynamic Form Submission**: Users can complete and submit forms based on the templates. Data is securely stored in a MySQL database.

### Data Query and Export
- **Export Data**: Functionality to query stored submissions and export data as CSV files for reporting and analysis.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: Spring Security with JWT
- **Data Export**: OpenCSV

## Development Plan

### 1. Set Up the Project
- Create a new Spring Boot project including Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, MySQL Driver, and JJWT.
- Setup React application using `create-react-app`.
- Install necessary NPM packages.

### 2. Database Schema Design
- **User Model**: Manages credentials and profile information.
- **Form Template Model**: Handles the storage of customizable form templates.
- **Form Data Model**: Stores data from submitted forms.

### 3. Backend Development
- Implement authentication using Spring Security and JWT.
- Develop CRUD APIs for form template management.
- Handle form submissions and store data securely.

### 4. Frontend Development
- Implement forms for user registration and login.
- Create interfaces for form template creation and modification.
- Develop dynamic forms for submissions and functionality for data export.

### 5. Security Considerations
- Secure all server communications with HTTPS.
- Protect against CSRF, XSS, and other vulnerabilities.
- Validate and sanitize inputs to prevent SQL Injection and other attacks.

### 6. Testing and Deployment
- Perform unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito for the backend and Jest for the frontend.
- Deploy on platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Additional Tools and Considerations
- Manage configurations using Spring's external configuration capabilities.
- Consider using Spring Cloud Config for managing complex configurations.
- Ensure responsive design using frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI.
